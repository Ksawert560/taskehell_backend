== Description

This is the **backend** for the **Taskhell** project, developed as part of the 'Internet Technologies' labs. The backend is built using PHP and provides a RESTful API for managing tasks.

== Features

* REST API for task management
* User authentication with basic security practices
* Input validation
* Dockerized setup with PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin services

== Technologies Used

* PHP
* MySQL
* Docker
* Apache (via dockerized PHP service)

== Setup

=== Prerequisites

* Docker

=== Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file by following the structure provided in `example.env`.  
Remember to set secure values for:

* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`
* `MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD`
* `PEPPER`

=== Build and Run

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

The services will be available on the ports defined in your `.env` file.  
Proposed ports are:

* `8080` for the API
* `8081` for phpMyAdmin

== API Endpoints

You will find all the available routes and logic in `endpoints.php`:

* `POST /login` → Credentials validation 
* `PUT /users` → User registration
* `PUT /lists` → List registration
* `PUT /tasks` → Task registration
* `PUT /tasks/random` → Random task registration
* `PATCH /users` → User data update
* `PATCH /tasks` → Task data update
* `GET /lists` → Return all lists owned by a given user
* `GET /tasks?finished=[0/1]?random=[0/1]` → Return all tasks from a given list (filtered by status and or if they were randomly generated)
* `DELETE /users` → User removal
* `DELETE /lists` → List removal
* `DELETE /tasks` → Task removal

== Notes

* The backend includes basic input validation and security mechanisms.
* For development purposes, phpMyAdmin is available to browse and manage the database.
* This project is intended for educational use and may require additional security hardening for production.
